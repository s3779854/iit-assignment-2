    <!-- AR SECTION -->
    <h2 style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;"> AUGMENTED REALITY </h2>
    
    <h3 style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">What does it do?</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;"> Augmented reality (AR) is technology that uses sounds, images and test to then interact and effect the world we see. It creates videos and pictures which adds a layer to reality to create experience of characters and images being there. Augmented reality does focus specifically on the use of mobile technology such as cameras in smart phones and GPS location. However, it is inexpensive for users of smartphones compared to Virtual Reality (VR) which is like AR technology, but instead is completely altering the reality. </br>Augmented reality is currently being used for a variety of novelty effects such as Snapchat and Instagram filters, but also is used for various beneficial applications such as navigation systems, furniture companies and even sport broadcasters.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">AR is currently being used in a variety of smartphone apps such as Pokémon Go. Pokémon GO use AR technology to create the feel as if Pokémon are there with the camera showing the real world with a Pokémon in front of it. It influenced the amount of AR games in the smartphone industry as many games tried to follow suit and have the same sort of feel to their game. </br>The earliest record of Augmented Reality to have been created and used is in 1968, a professor, Ivan Sutherland, invented the first augmented reality device called The Sword of Damocles. With the help of his student, Bob Sproull, The Sword of Damocles was a head-mounted display that hung from the ceiling and the user would feel as if they were in an alternate reality because of computerized graphics. Even though, this is closer to Virtual Reality, it created a massive steppingstone for the development of AR. </br>In 1992, a research lab, USAF, created the first mainstream AR system that was the earliest version of Augmented Reality available to the public. The AR was called Virtual Fixtures and essentially placed information in front of the users work environment, to make it interactive. This system was the model unit to then create the AR we know in the modern day. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">The development for augmented reality is rapidly increasing as the need for AR is increasing. AR is in higher demand for medical purposes, research and military purposes. With smart devices and medical machines improving over time, augmented reality will slowly follow suit with the growth and development. It has also impacted the travel industry as it has grown in popularity. Travel companies have reported that hotels and popular tourist attractions have adopted AR technology to encourage tourists to visit or stay at their local hotels. AR gives customers the opportunity to have information on popular tourist locations 24/7. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">The future for AR isn't limited to novelty items and applications on smartphones. Augmented reality is being researched into being used for contact lenses and glasses. Google did attempt this with the Google Glass in 2013 but was unsuccessful. However, AR research is being slowly introduced into the medical world by helping individuals' issues with sight or who are completely blind. It is also helping nurses and doctors currently help find veins easier within a patient with a hand-held scanner that has AR technology to make veins easier to find.</br>Social media applications will also see an increase of AR use as many platforms have adopted filters. AR has a close connection with Artificial Intelligence (AI) so the development of AI and AR will also sufficiently increase. According to research, the total number of active social media users currently sits at 3.8 billion. Social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat all have AR and AI technology embedded in their application. With filters on the rise and with Snapchat and Instagram having over 1million active users currently, it is unsurprising how in demand it is.</p>
   
    <h3 style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">What is the likely impact?</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">With AR becoming more and more in demand, the impact it will have on various areas in life can be drastic. Areas such as medical, education, businesses are most likely to be impacted with the progressive development of AR technology. </br>With the medical industry, changes are rapidly approaching as doctors and surgeons are having help of AR technology in their practices with their patients. The AR used within the medical industry aren't taking away jobs for the surgeons but instead increasing them. As AR technology becomes more prevalent, there will be jobs that will train the surgeons on how to use the equipment. Jobs that will also be created will be individuals who will do maintenance on these machines, since all machines have a specialized mechanic.</br>With teachers, having children become more interactive with their work and giving them a more "hands-on" feeling can drastically change with AR technology as all kids nowadays are born into the world of technology. This doesn't necessarily mean that teachers will be out of a job, it will be making their job easier and more accessible to more tools to teach children of all ages. As laptops and interactive whiteboards became a mandatory educational tool, so will AR technology in specific courses and classroom atmospheres.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">Businesses and the marketing industry will drastically change and development with the helping hand of AR technology. There are many instances where AR technology is already being currently used in the marketing industry, however it will become a new norm for the industry. Businesses will market their brand and products through AR technology through Augmented reality apps and social media additions. Companies sell their brand through face filters for Snapchat, Facebook and applications alike, which then in turn prompts and markets their products in a fun positive way. Businesses, such as furniture businesses, may invest into an Augmented reality application where users can see what a certain couch or chair may look like in their own home. This will cause a boost in jobs as businesses, large and small, will want people with these specific skills to create the AR technology needed.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">How will this affect you?</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">As AR technology continues to grow, the impact this may have on everyone's daily lifestyle may be small or large due to an individual's profession. I personally, won't be affected drastically other than occasionally noticing new applications adopting the face filter technology, which as stated consists of AR technology. This mentality may apply to other people within the same age group and same situation as we don't see AR being used other than social media applications and video games on our smartphones.</br>Only drastic possible change that would immediately affect me and others would be the way brands are marketed towards younger generations. As the marketing business adopts AR technology, how we preserve the business may change and possibly give it a better outlook on them. AR technology in the form of face filters for social media may cause teenagers to young adults to give a better positive opinion on a company as they are become more "trendy" and "cool." </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">Family and friends may only be affected if they possibly work in an industry where they are exploring the use of AR technology, such as medical, marketing, educational etc. As the medical industry already has aspects of AR technology in their profession, the increase of AR would not come to a surprise to everyone in the industry. This will impact surgeons and nurses who will now have to learn the basics of the AR technology, which could lead to them gaining a new job or a possible pay rise.</br>As AR technology improves, for anyone wanting to get into the marketing and IT side of a business, can have a drastic increase of demand for programmers. Higher demand of such specific skills directly affects anyone possibly in RMIT and universities alike that offer Bachelor of IT or similar courses.</p>
    
    <!-- DATA SCIENCE SECTION -->
    <h2 style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">DATA SCIENCE/REALITY</h2>
    
    <h3 style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;"> What does it do? </h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">Data Science and Data Analytics are two different topics but related in the same area. Data Science is cleaning and preparing data through methods of mathematics, programming and use of statistics. Whereas Data Analytics is looking through the data and finding the correlation between the sets of data, this may involve mechanical processing or algorithmic processing. Data Science and Data Analytics come hand in hand when it comes to job professions and topic of research.</br>Data Analytics partakes in a huge role within the marketing and financial industry as Data Analytics is used to predict trends in markets, the potential risks and helps to prevent fraud. Without Data Analytics, finances would have no efficient way on adjusting necessary prices, fraud that could ruin a company and lose thousands of money and stock from market trends going undetected. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">It is currently also used within research and medical facilities, crime prevention and environmental issues. Essentially, anything that may have a pattern or trend uses Data Analytics and Data Science.</br>Currently, healthcare has progressed the most out of all industries to incorporate Data Analytics. It is currently used widespread in machines to help drug discovery, the market for the said drugs and treatment within the hospitals. Without the use of Data Analytics, treatment of patients and the quality of treatment wouldn't be where it is today, millions of people would be dying more of illnesses and viruses compared to the amount today.</br>Another area that is currently involved with Data Analytics is the travel industry. Travel industry gathers information on customer's preferences and desires, which then leads to personalized travel recommendations. The information also helps indicate if sales are working in relation to the customized offers and customer's needs.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">Data Science is commonly used for Internet Search, Recommender Systems and Digital Advertisements. Internet search is how Google and Bing find their best result searches within fraction of seconds through algorithms and specific mathematics. This is to make sure search queries have the best results for users to be able to find what they want.</br> Recommender Systems follow similar aspects to Internet Search. Essentially, recommender systems find relevant products from products available and creates suggestions based on user's relevance and demands. It sorts through billions of different products and possibly different websites at the same time. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">Digital Advertisements are specific digital banners and billboards using data science algorithms based on clickthrough rate (CTR). This gives also gives specific advertisements to users which then leads to their specific products dedicated to their needs. </br>Both Data Science and Analytics need knowledge of SQL and Python to produce and store the results from all the data. However, the outcome of the two will be different. One, data science, will focus on the problems and patterns whereas Data Analytics design the techniques and solutions to apply. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">The near future for the use of Data Analytics/Science is inevitable due to data being everywhere. As social media grows, so will sensitive data users input into the applications, databases will be needed to become more complex and secure as time goes on. With social media, it also has content being posted multiple times a day, increasing every minute, every year. The user base will also continue to grow, and recommendations will have to become more specific and personalized. </br>As machines become more prominent within industries as machines have rapidly developed over the years. As machines learn new algorithms and data inputs, it causes the quality of algorithms and tools to increase. As the algorithms are implemented, it is accepting data which outputs a result, such as tools or cameras of higher quality made. Over the next few years, these machines will advance with the data it gathers and creating better quality products. </p>

    <h3 style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">What is the likely impact? </h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">The continued growth of Data Analytics/Science is imminent as data is always being created and processed. With this, we as humans have created a strong dependency on machines as they process our data faster and more efficient. Job loss will slowly rise as the development of superhuman machines are on the rise too. Companies will use the algorithms for their data to be processed by machines to beat their competitors and will lead to a decrease in jobs.</br> Data storage will improve within the coming years as machines learn better algorithms. As more data is being processed and created, storage will need to increase over the coming years. Cloud computing services will increase and won't become optional as time goes on. Data machines creating more and more data, improving the cloud saving algorithms along the way which means data server technicians will soon a redundant job. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">Data Science has a tool called Docker which makes deploying algorithms into the machine and easier to scale the data. This helps increases the amount of data and the type we derive from devices which is then puts into machines to learn the algorithms and stored into cloud saving. As this process become more in demand and when cloud saving becomes more efficient, jobs will be impacted drastically as the use of humans won't be necessary. The jobs that would typically be reserved for humans will now be given to a more efficient and error-preventing system. </br> However, with all this being said, not all jobs are at lose. Companies will need standardization for these machines. Even though the use of machines and Docker may help growth and automation in the company, standardization is still necessary as standards will need to be upheld, regardless of manual processing or automated processing.</br> If companies do adopt the use of machine automation for the Data Science/Analytics, current existing employees may not necessarily lose their job as they can use thier skills elsewhere. Even though, machines taking over humans' jobs is still a fair amount of time away, the fear still lingers. Employees may be able to use their skillsets in other departments and projects, even possibly making higher leveled business decisions.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;"> How will this affect you? </h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">As time goes on, Data Science/Analytics will improve many areas within the IT industry such as cloud computing, machines, IoT and others alike. As for impact, it'll impact people within that above industries as potential unemployment. As machines become better within the world of Data Science/Analytics, some jobs may change for the better whilst others for the worse.</br> Since the improvement of cloud computing is connected to Data Analytics/Science, it'll drastically impacts everyone in various ways. Again, the potential of unemployment as cloud computing becomes more efficient and therefore, less employees to actual store physical data. However, since cloud computing and data are improving, researchers will have more data to manipulate and save. This also applies to students and the everyday citizen who may use cloud computing for work or education purposes.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"style="font-family:verdana;">Data Science directly impacts Google, Bing, Wikipedia etc as they have recommender systems and internet search. As more users continue to user these websites, more data and information is gathered and sorted through, giving the users the best response. Since these websites want to give the best results based on user desires, the systems over time will have to improve and become more complicated as it tries to compensate for the number of users. Due to these reason, daily users of these websites, which is essentially everyone with a smart phone or computer, data for these results may become more adequate as more customization.</br> If Data Analytics does continue to grow, the medical industry can see a boost in quality of treatment and prescription drugs. With this, patients all around the world will benefit and treatment quality will possibly cure or prevent illnesses it couldn't do so before. The impact it has can affect anyone around us and anyone working within the industry as their job may become more in demand.</p>
