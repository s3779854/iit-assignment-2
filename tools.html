                    <p>The trail on our Git repository is not an accurate description of the timeline of our work, as all of our resources were compiled together on the same day, rather than gradual updates. The main reason of this is because of the nature of the assignment being primarily research based. While conducting research, we were mainly uploading our work to an office365 document. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Once we were satisfied, we would translate our information to HTML, and then finally to the repository. We did run into one issue with github, where a push command overwrote all of our resources causing some panic. This was fixed through a force push command from a team member who had pulled all of the files earlier.
