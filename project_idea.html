<p>
Our project idea relates to the topic of global economy. The concept we came up with as a group is a game that simulates the real-world economy in order to educate the player. It will tackle many issues that arise with the international exchange of goods and services in which the user will be tasked to manage and take care of. To manage the economy, the user will be responsible to regulate the economy by adjusting aspects of it which the game will respond appropriately by correlating such changes to real-world events that have occurred. The goal of the game would be to show the user the potential life-altering effects just small changes have on the economy, and the very fragile nature of its existence.
</br>
It will be difficult to address all issues regarding the world’s economy due to the gigantic scope, so the game will feature the economy in general and also represent recent events, so it feels relevant, valuable and intriguing to the player. Current affairs that will be addressed will include but not be limited to: 
<ol>
  <li>
  <b>The effects of diseases on global economy, including the recent Coronavirus pandemic.</b> The global economy is not exempt from the fear and panic manifesting as disease continues to spread across nations. </li>
    <ol type ="I">
      <li>Exportation and importation of goods and services will become restrained as supply chains cannot be accessed due to strict border limitations and small businesses will be suspended due to lack of revenue. </li>
      <li>The principle of supply-and-demand. Demand for essential items will rise however supply will remain stagnant which will inflate the prices while non-essential items will decrease as there will be less demand of such luxuries, thus negatively impacting companies that gross high amounts of money from selling such products. </li>
      <li>Because of the instability of the economy, the government will be pressured to fund local companies and individuals to keep the country from further breakdown. </li>
    </ol>
  <li>
  Similarly, <b>natural disasters are just as unpredictable and deadly to the economy.</b> With recent news of natural disasters, we can see that tons of resources and money are used to help recover from the crisis. For example, the devastating bushfires of Australia that happens yearly brings upon economic shortcomings. It brings great damage to industries such as farming and tourism, as there needs to be billions of dollars for the government to put down the fires and bring the place back on track.
  </li>
  
  <li>
  <b>Climate change is also a big factor that would control the economy.</b> The overuse of natural resources would have various severe consequences on humans.
  </li>
  
  <li>
  Overall, such natural phenomena have an acute impact on global economy as it can materialize at seemingly random times and send the global economy into turmoil in an instant. Depending on moderation, communities may not be well-equipped or prepared to deal with such disaster and it will leave an undeniably huge impact on the economy. 
  </li>
  
  <li>
  Something that also threatens the economy are <b>man-made causes.</b> Economic instability is encouraged by the ongoing tension growing between countries and regions. With different world leaders and prominent figures, they have a lot of power over the world’s economy and can manipulate it easier. With different people comes different motives, views, goals and policies regarding the economy which causes conflict between communities. This can bring about conflict, political uprisings, civil unrest and in the most severe cases, war. For example, in 2020, Brexit took a big shock to the economy. And shortly later in the same year the trade war between China and the United State caused more stock market instability.
  </li>
  
  <li>
  There is a concept known as <b>“debt wave”</b> characterized by companies and organizations borrowing money from the government in order to use it in their big project investment. This can have a positive effect on the economy, however from the statistics produced by The World Bank (2020), the world GDP has grown for 4% in 2019, but at the same time the debt has grown for 6%. As shown the number of debts is growing faster than the economic growth. This can produce another global financial crisis due to the big economic bubble made by this debt wave. 
  </li>
  
  <li>
  There are many more crises and causes for global economic pressure including famine, poverty, overpopulation, war, corruption etc. 
There are many things going on, so it is important for use to understand the economic issue around us. With specific problems and scenarios discussed, the game will now have lots of content for the player to experiment with in order to educate themselves. The user will be able to control and monitor what occurs in the simulation, and therefore carry out sets of tasks to either fix the economy or send it further into destruction.

<p>There are many things going on, so it is important for use to understand the economic issue around us. With specific problems and scenarios discussed, the game will now have lots of content for the player to experiment with in order to educate themselves. The user will be able to control and monitor what occurs in the simulation, and therefore carry out sets of tasks to either fix the economy or send it further into destruction. </p>
 
<p>There will be two modes available in the game: one where the user can freely test and demonstrate events, and a campaign event where the user must deal with randomly generated events by the game and try to salvage the situation. For the campaign mode, the goal for the user will be trying to upkeep the peace of the world economy, and the game will end when the world goes into disarray or lack of adequate funding to spend, signifying failure. </br>
Randomly triggered events can consist of natural or man-made causes. An example of a natural cause would be a tsunami hitting the coast of a very influential area, like Japan. The program, to be as accurate as possible, will retrieve information from Google of similar events and relay that data into the game for the user to interpret, and the user, with the role as a ‘world leader’ will decide how to deal with the situation. Actions that can be taken by the user could possibly be taking funds from somewhere else and funneling it towards the natural disaster relief. However, with taking funds from another place, there will be consequences, like that place going into instability or having severe losses. An example of a man-made cause could be the tensions arising between two areas, and them deciding to cut all economic ties. Just like the previous scenario, this would be out of the user’s control, and they will have to be able to work around the economic losses and keep sustaining it.
</br>
Ideally, the game would be crafted in a game engine suitable for beginner game developers. A candidate for this could be the Unity engine as there are many readily available resources, since it is a very popular game development software. As for the graphics for the game, our group can opt to purchasing pre-made assets, so we do not need to generate our own graphics, making the development stage much quicker and having much more refined graphics, versus having amateur self-made graphics. 
</br>
The game will have constraints as there is simply not enough data out there to predict what will happen when a specific event happens, as deviations can occur, and it is very circumstantial. But it will be a very good starting point for users who do not want to delve into news articles and want to take it slowly or educate themselves with a fun, interactive experience.
