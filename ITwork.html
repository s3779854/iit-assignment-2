                    <h2>Interview with a Web officer</h2>

                <p>
                    Through conducting an interview with Alastair, a web officer IT professional, an insight is gained into how time is spent within IT work in what kind of work completed, day to day interactions and their challenges.
                </p>

                <section>
                    <h3>What kind of work is done by the IT professional? </h3>

                    <p>Alastair works at an educational company which provides teacher standards for all of Australia, which hold a large amount of resources online. He is required to maintain the information and keep it updated for its users, for brand new campaigns as well as existing resources. At a core, he is required to resolve routine technical issues faced, while managing the content on the website. Additionally, he is required to monitor page analytics in metrics such as who is viewing the pages, how often, which pages experience the most traffic and bounce rates in order to find solutions to the effectiveness of the information systems in place. Beyond this, he also provides support for system users, and from time to time completes web design work.</p>
                    <p>
                        Professional IT work can differ greatly depending on the role, however generally will involve managing data through the use of technology such as software, computers, networks, servers and more. There are a variety of job titles floating around, however these jobs may very well require very similar skills and involve similar work. This means qualified IT professionals may apply themselves to many roles.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public? </h3>

                    <p>Alastair’s place of work operates with a lean IT team with only two members permanently engaged in day to day IT practices. The other member of the IT team is a Digital Advisor who has more authority in higher level decision making, in which a web officer will report unresolvable non-routine issues to, whilst updating on general daily progress in tasks that have been assigned. </p>
                    <p>
                        The Web information system that is maintained by Alastair, supports many internal users daily, who need relevant, timely information for their own respective work. As such, he is expected to interact with multiple stakeholders in ensuring its smooth operation.
                        These parties include content creating teams, who will provide the new campaigns to be uploaded, in which there must be a proactive effort to ensure the website is presenting up to date information.</p>

                    <p>
                        Communications and marketing teams, such as social media teams, who have needs of how information is presented for the targeted audience, this involves the need for accurate analytics from the website or surveys that are obtained.
                        Finally, there are general users of the system (educational staff) who use the site to gather teaching resources for their own work. These users generally require support in accessing or using the page due to forgotten passwords, bugs or changes in the website.
                        For this particular role, the interactions mentioned were all internal within the organisation.

                <section>
                    <h3>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time? </h3>

                    <p>Most days, the bulk of work completed (around 50% - 60%) is spent on the main working job title requirements; in Alastair’s instance this is managing the website with updates and improvements, completing aforementioned work described as the work of a web officer. On an ad hoc basis, analytics work will be carried out on the website or on user surveys. This occurs less frequently as it takes time for the data to gather and be usable for analysis to draw useful conclusions. </p>
                    <p>
                        The remainder of the day (25%) is spent in meetings, where the respective teams described earlier within the business work in liaison to identify the movements within the business that are being worked on, as well as future directions and the considerations of such. There are also general social meetings with these teams that occur weekly.
                    </p>
                    <p>The remaining work is generally spent assisting the users of the website with their access to the content within, as they have problems with passwords, general navigation after updates or need general miscellaneous support. The time spent on this work varies greatly, as after updates it is likely there will be significantly more users requiring assistance, potentially bottlenecking progress on routine technical tasks, by contrast there may be time periods where there are less requests for assistance. </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>

                    <p>The most difficult aspect of Alastair’s position has been entering a business with a clear focus on the teacher standards rather than IT based practices. This is because all of the content that is uploaded to the website, the requests made, and support required contains a lot of educational jargon that is difficult to understand and apply in a role of developing the online content operation.</p>
                    <p>This difficulty may at sometimes be extended through the mismatch of IT technical knowledge also, where many users are not tech minded may have ideas that are impossible to satisfy with such ease, or without the use of significant resources. It can be difficult to provide a solution that will translate the request considering costs or time constraints. As a relatively new member of the team, there is definitely some pressure to fit in to the work environment where many different people and their skills come together, highlighting the importance of being able to integrate IT skills into the wider business world.

                    <h3>From Student to Professional</h3>

                    <h3>Before being hired, what did you think was required from you (Who were companies hiring searching for)?</h3>


                    <p>
                        As a student, all hiring companies would list experience as a requirement, however each role would have different ideas of the employee they would think would suit their work environment. For this role, there was an emphasis on soft skills that put him above the other candidates within the interviewing process as lots of interactions would occur every day with content the content being handled, and the nature of the team environment within the culture. Other IT roles may have a need for more technical based skills, however developing strong interpersonal skills will work to benefit IT professionals in some way, particularly communication.

                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Has your perception of work changed from being a student to becoming a professional?  </h3>
                    <p>From previously working on web design as a freelancer, there are big differences in decisions that are made with funding in comparing smaller jobs or even assignments from university, to investments made to improve a whole organisation and its processes. Becoming a part of these decisions holds a sense of responsibility. There is also the difference of working with people from many different ages and settling into the 9-5 schedule!</p>
                    
                    <h3>Impact of coronavirus</h3>
                    <p>The impact of covid-19 has not been detrimental to the daily work done by the IT professional interviewed. This is because majority of the work can be done from home via a computer device, and interactions between people can be conducted through video calls and email. A large majority of work carried out by the IT professional does not require immediate face to face contact reducing the impact of isolation.</p>
