Rica loves to dance and sing. She also loves to cook Filipino dish from time to time. She is interested in IT because she is intrigued on what's the behind the scenes of each software that we are using nowadays and how we can further enhance them in the future. She is interested to know the basic elements of the web and be able to read or understand them. She started her interest in IT when she started her internship commencement, as she has realized how important for her to have some basic knowledge in IT. Her IT experience is basically using Microsoft Software for work and school. She has also experience accounting software called MYOB and Clockify. </p>

    <p><b>Nikita Pereira (s3821154) </b> is a woman that has a nice mixed cultural background of Croatian and Italian, however she only speaks English at home. She knows the basics of Croatian, but she felt as if anyone who interacts with foreign family would know the basic greetings. She completed high school in 2018, decided to defer for a year to work full-time and now she is studying at RMIT. Other than studying and coming to university, she enjoys a variety of other hobbies and pass times. She’s a massive gamer, but also enjoy board games or reading books. Her passion IT came on rather suddenly as a lightbulb moment by people simply pointing out to her that she was rather good at certain areas of IT. She spent a lot of her high school life analyzing Physic and Chemistry based graphs and data, but also enjoyed creating these graphs based on statistics they gather on a variety of subjects. When she had her first brush of databases, she slowly fell in-love more and more with all of IT.</p>

    <p><b>Angela Mao (s3779854)</b> a New Zealand-born Chinese Australian that speaks fluent English and little Cantonese. She has completed year 12 VCE and currently aiming to graduate university. She enjoys a variety of things including gaming and more so reading and drawing. From a young age, I've been surrounded by the internet and technology which has made me technology inclined. Her first laptop was given to her at age 6 in 2007 from her older sister who didn't spend too much time on it, since no one else in the family used electronics. She has experienced the internet from then on and developed a strong interest in anything related to programming and coding, however the only practical learning she have done is schoolwork from high school and occasional small self-taught learning through studying someone else's code. To take her passion for IT further, she is undertaking education under RMIT since she knew it's a highly regarded university when it comes to IT and IT-related things, on top of it being convenient in location.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b> Nanako Yamauchi (s3845837) </b> is from Japan. She can speak Japanese, English and a little bit Chinese, She has been living in Australia since year 10. She really like to listen K-POP song. She always watched something on You Tube. Her interest to study IT is after when she came to Australia. In Year 11 she chose Computing class because when she was in other country before she came to Australia, she had the Computing class where she studied kind of programming. So, she chose Computing because she had a confidence with that. </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Ziqiang Lin (s3792327)</b> currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University. He lives in Brooklyn, a suburb in Melbourne. His nationality is Chinese. He can speak both Chinese and English fluently. He loves to read and take note of the new knowledge he learns. He enjoys communicating with new people. He loves game that requires logic and problem solving. Ziqiang is also a big supporter of cat! He loves to code his program and see the result of his program to come out perfectly. From when he was little he’s not really an artist child, and can't get the result he wanted every time he draws something out, but coding is very logical and if he were to put the correct code the result would come out as how he wants it. His first encounter with coding is from the lesson he took in primary school when they have people coming in and show the different thing a robot can do with different command put into it. He found it very cool and fascinating and started his journey with information technology from there. </p>

    <p><b>Leo Dick (s3662283)</b> is doing his final semester of my Bachelor of business (Logistics and Supply Chain Management). He is 21 and born in Sydney, although he grew up and have lived in Melbourne for the great majority of his life. He finished High School at Wesley College in Prahran where he completed the final IT unit in year 11. After year 12 he decided to attend RMIT studying Economics and Finance, until during the 2nd year where he found he was not as interested in his course, he decided to swap to Logistics and Supply Chain management as a major. He found his new studies a lot more enjoyable and interesting. Growing up he played plenty of sport including soccer, swimming, athletics (high jump), however in his downtime he would always play games as he would watch and play games with his brother since he was young. His interest in IT has grown from constantly being surrounded by technology each and every day. Observing the changes in technology growing up fed his interest, aside from the fact that he was also using and wanting to use all the latest consumer technology with greater specs each year.  </p>
