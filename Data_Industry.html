A fact that Business Analyst and System Analyst needs to work together with the IT Team to produce a solution that are consistent and variable to current issues. In terms of skills and knowledge, they are required to have knowledge and experience with SQL (Structure Query Language), Oracle, and programming however with System Analyst,  it requires more broad technical knowledge as they work most closely with technology and required to maintain the database of the company while data analyst is more on interpreting a report from the database.</p>

<p><I><b> Question to Nikita Pereira: With the result of the research from above, did that change your opinion about your Ideal job? Why or Why Not? </b></i></p>
  <p>After the research presented to me from Rica, it doesn’t fully change my mind on my ideal job. It, however, does open my eyes a bit on the possibility on progressing within the industry if my skills become adequate for the company. Is data analyst still my ideal job? Currently yes, however it will be subject to change for many reasons. I may in the future after possible personal research want to work towards a data scientist instead. Since data analysts and data scientists do work quite closely, having a change won’t be too detrimental to my studies or profession.  </p>
  <p>That said, my ideal job could change based on my continuation throughout university or hobbies relating to IT. RMIT university does introduce a variety of areas in the IT department which could persuade me to adventure down another route for a possible new ideal profession. Other hobbies like video games, manipulating code, files within a game and html may also persuade in the future my ideal job but for now they are for fun, not work. </p>
  <p>After the research, I don’t believe my ideal job has changed. Salary doesn’t faze me either regarding my profession as it’s what I want to do based on what I like and what I am good at. The only thing that would hold me back would be demand and the skills required to obtain the ideal job of Data Analyst. </p>
