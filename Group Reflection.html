    <h2> What went well </h2>
    <p> Everyone was punctual to each meeting; our team dynamic was positive, and everyone was friendly</p>
    <p> As a team, our dynamic was positive and uplifting, which created a comfortable atmosphere when calling on MS Teams. With every meeting, everyone was punctual and consistent when it came to timing and the structure of the meeting. The work ethic within the meetings were constructive and majority of the time stayed within on topic. </p>  
    
    <h2> What could be improved </h2>
    <p> During the holiday period, we did not communicate on how we would begin our assignment. </p>
    <p> During the Easter holiday period, we didn’t communicate during the time as some were not online and enjoying the relaxing time. Communication within the group was inconsistent and we did not plan much or when our meeting was going to happen. Due to this, we did start our assignment later than expected.</p>
    
    <h2> One thing that was surprising </h2>
    <p> It was surprising that we would be forced to communicate through online methods, as it is a new experience for each of us; being especially important in our group collaboration. </p>
    <p> Due to circumstances, the most surprising thing for the group was that the communication methods were a new experience for everyone as we were all forced to only communicate through online resources. Since this is a group collaboration, it was at times difficult to make sure we got consistent replies but was surprising on how well it did work out for us in the end and even the group didn’t take a long time to communicate, group have a very good atmosphere.   </p>
    
    <h2> One thing that you learned about group </h2>
    <p> As a group, we learnt that working within a big group can be very beneficial as it can help with structure and proper delegation for the assignment. As the group holds everyone accountable, the work becomes clears as in what is needed to do and the structure of the assignment. An added factor that helped our worth ethic is the consistent video calls and growing a connection with the team due to circumstances. We all met face to face within the tutor but as the year went on, being pushed onto video calling helped build a bond as we still consistently saw each other and built a connection within the group.  </p>
