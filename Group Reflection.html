    <h2>Individual Reflection to the Group-Trevors Angels </h2>

        <p>The group went very well, everyone has a clear understanding in which task they are doing and the whole group has a clear aim to where we are heading. Because of this the group doesn't really have much communication, every meeting takes a very short amount of time to finish. The surprising thing is that even though the group didn’t take a long time to communicate we have a very good atmosphere in the group. Everyone is not hesitant to ask questions if something is not clear for them and everyone is happy to help. From this assignment I have learned that it is very important to get the whole group to understand the whole assignment before beginning the research and writing. Also, I learn that separate work in the group can make the group work more efficient and take out a lot of pressure in individuals. </p>

       <p> Working in this group has been a very pleasant experience for myself. This is mainly because all my team members were present for all of our meetings and would always respond to team messages. There was a good progression rate once we began the assignment, and I trusted each member to complete their work without worry. One improvement that could have been made was getting started slightly earlier, with the holiday period causing us to relax. I do believe this will improve for the next assignment. I was surprised by how well working online was, especially with having online face to face meetings, as they were an effective way to catch up rather than through text messaging. Between team meetings we would generally complete our own allocated tasks, and then collaborate to upload our progress to github, which is why our activity was all on one day. </p>

       <p> I believe the group, Trevor's Angels, was a great experience in working with them as everyone was accepting and effective regarding our work. The way we worked and the way we interacted was always positive and consistent. We all communicated well and consistently in every meeting.  Biggest downfall of our group was that we did start later compared to other groups considering we started after the Easter break.  It may have possibly put more pressure on our team. I personally learnt to not be bias to big group projects because I always use to fear working with groups that had more than 3 or 4 people as I am quite socially awkward. It was pleasant to work with this group despite it was a big group. I was surprised how well we worked as a team without only meeting each other for only 3 weeks at university and little contact before the assignment and pandemic. </p>

    <p> My perception to our group- Trevor’s Angels has been amazing. The communication between us was easy and convenient. We always make sure that every after our meeting we have satisfied or solve our questions in our task. We also remind each other at the end of our meeting the schedule of our next video call. I thought that due to this pandemic, group work will be hard, but I was proven wrong. I am so grateful that we all have the same level of motivation when it comes to our task. The downside for all of us, was when we did not used the semester break to communicate and start the assignment 2. Honestly, it did put pressure and worry to me because we only have few days left, however, everyone was very efficient and helpful that the tasks did not felt heavy. When I heard that we needed to form a group of 6, I though, it is too many people for the assignment, that we may not need 1 or 2 more person. However I was wrong because having a six members in the group do actually work and we were able to delegate the task equally to each other, but most importantly, I have learnt that if we work together and have the same level of moral and efficiency, everything can work despite of any challenges. </p>

    <h2>As a Group: </h2>
    <h2> What went well </h2>
    <p> Everyone was punctual to each meeting; our team dynamic was positive, and everyone was friendly</p>
    <p> As a team, our dynamic was positive and uplifting, which created a comfortable atmosphere when calling on MS Teams. With every meeting, everyone was punctual and consistent when it came to timing and the structure of the meeting. The work ethic within the meetings were constructive and majority of the time stayed within on topic. </p>  
    
    <h2> What could be improved </h2>
    <p> During the holiday period, we did not communicate on how we would begin our assignment. </p>
    <p> During the Easter holiday period, we didn’t communicate during the time as some were not online and enjoying the relaxing time. Communication within the group was inconsistent and we did not plan much or when our meeting was going to happen. Due to this, we did start our assignment later than expected.</p>
    
    <h2> One thing that was surprising </h2>
    <p> It was surprising that we would be forced to communicate through online methods, as it is a new experience for each of us; being especially important in our group collaboration. </p>
    <p> Due to circumstances, the most surprising thing for the group was that the communication methods were a new experience for everyone as we were all forced to only communicate through online resources. Since this is a group collaboration, it was at times difficult to make sure we got consistent replies but was surprising on how well it did work out for us in the end and even the group didn’t take a long time to communicate, group have a very good atmosphere.   </p>
    
    <h2> One thing that you learned about group </h2>
    <p> As a group, we learnt that working within a big group can be very beneficial as it can help with structure and proper delegation for the assignment. As the group holds everyone accountable, the work becomes clears as in what is needed to do and the structure of the assignment. An added factor that helped our worth ethic is the consistent video calls and growing a connection with the team due to circumstances. We all met face to face within the tutor but as the year went on, being pushed onto video calling helped build a bond as we still consistently saw each other and built a connection within the group.  </p>
